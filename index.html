                                <li class="list-group-item">"It helps manage schedules for multiple employees and can auto create shifts. You can also communicate with employees regarding shift changes and general messages. It also helps you manage payroll pretty simply. Overall
                                    it is great software with some great functions. The best feature is employees can remote login from mobile devices pr swipe in instead of paper timekeeping. They can also track their own hours and swap shifts. However,

                                <li class="list-group-item ">"The most helpful part of When to Work is the ability to see all of my assigned shifts and important messages from my boss in one place. I am always able to tell exactly when I need to work and what my boss wants me to
                                    know in just a few taps. This truly is one of the best apps for workers in any company, large or small. When my boss sends a message, I am able to quickly find it after I am alerted via email or phone notification.
                                    My least favorite part of When to Work is the amount of menu screens it has. It tends to "hide" things under 3 or 4 menus that are not always the easiest to navigate. To find open shifts to pick up, for example, I have
                                    to go through 4 different screens until I am able to pull up the date that I want. This can become very annoying after a while as I need to check my shifts rather often. " -5 star review from Matheson M. April 2021</li>

                                    for employees to apply for if someone calls off their shift. The ability to enter when an employee is NOT available so we do not schedule them when they cannot be here. Time off requests is a great feature as well.

                                <li class="list-group-item">"One of my favorite things about Sling is that it allows me to get out of Excel spreadsheets explaining to staff what they should do on an event day. Now, it's simple for them to login and see what, when and where they
                                    should be to contribute to a successful event! Having a mobile app is a gamechanger! I wish the message feature was replaced with some type of instant messager similar to Slack. It would keep all communication about
